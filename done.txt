2012-05-04 Finished implementing Command.run(), by using an OrderedDict to store opt_args so we can know which optional args have not been passed.

2012-05-05 Made hello.greet() return a string, rather than print directly to stdout, but still had command-line app display output, using optional output_alg param when creating app.

2012-05-07 Added basic support for option/flag short names.

2012-05-07 Made opt_args an optional arg to @app.command, rather than encoding 'Optional Args:' in the docstring. Dropped docstring 'sections'.

2012-05-08 Added optional type converters for function inputs.

2012-05-04 Supported global options, via the somewhat-clunky make_global_opts.

2012-08-26 Made the App catch --help/-h and 'help' (command), rather than having Commands do it.

2012-08-26 Handled help for non-existent commands.

2012-09-03 Handled help for programs without a main command.

2012-09-03 Handled no command being specified in an App without a main_cmd. It should print a general usage statement (if available) and list the commands.

2012-09-03 Added a usage_msg kwarg to the App constructor and the command/main decorators. For App, if you want to keep faith with PEP 257, you can do App(usage_msg=__doc__).

2012-09-06 Implemented Command._get_param_summaries().

2012-09-06 Added a semi-sane parser for docstrings, so that usage messages with multiple paragraphs work, and different styles of param docs are understood. It's not elegant and it needs work, but it's a big improvement over what I had.

2012-09-10 Add info on args, options, and flags to help.

2012-09-10 Got usage message displaying core elements for Apps with only a main command.

2012-09-10 Fill each paragraph of a Command's help message separately. Improves readability significantly.

2012-09-10 Preserved indented blocks in docstrings exactly as they were written when creating help messages.

2012-09-11 Renamed param_types to arg_types, as it's shorter.

2012-09-11 Added arg_types dict to App(). It is used to default arg_types for each command, except where command-specific arg_types were specified.

2012-09-11 Handled ValueError on arg_types type conversion, outputting a basic error message to the effect that the input was not valid.

2012-05-04 Got semi-working handling for the expected error cases. Overall exception handlers are the jurisdiction of app developers, so the default excepthook is left in place.

2012-09-14 Wrote a basic readme.

2012-09-19 Merged Command.flags with Command.opts and added Option.is_flag property.

2012-09-23 Moved type conversion callables to Arg and Option classes.

2012-09-24 Overhauled input parsing to split inputs into args and options at the app level.

2012-09-24 Made '--' specify that there are no options after it, and that all remaining inputs should be treated as args.

2012-09-24 Fixed '-' option behavior. We now accept multiple short names after a hyphen, if at most the last one requires a value, and values for short names no longer use the '=' separator, so we're much more getopt-like.

2012-09-24 Converted faked 'help' subcommand to a real subcommand.

2012-09-26 Fixed bug where options are interpreted as commands if they come after '--help'.

2012-09-26 Made '<app> help help' stop telling lies.

2012-05-04 Finished implementing Command.run(), by using an OrderedDict to store opt_args so we can know which optional args have not been passed.

2012-05-05 Made hello.greet() return a string, rather than print directly to stdout, but still had command-line app display output, using optional output_alg param when creating app.

2012-05-07 Added basic support for option/flag short names.

2012-05-07 Made opt_args an optional arg to @app.command, rather than encoding 'Optional Args:' in the docstring. Dropped docstring 'sections'.

2012-05-08 Added optional type converters for function inputs.

2012-09-06 Make sure usage message displays correctly for programs with a main command.

2012-08-22 Try to format usage message for device it's being displayed on (i.e., try to detect terminal width).

2012-05-04 Introspect basic usage messages for the app and any subcommands. Could involve requirements on docstring formatting and contents for advanced info - consider converting ' [Rr]eturn(s{0,1}) ' to ' [Oo]utput\1 ' in docstrings, as we output returned values (getting the grammar right for such a conversion might be really sticky).

2012-05-04 Handle exceptions properly. Right now they just print a useless message. They should explain the error and give a usage hint (multi-command programs should be smart about whether a valid command was used). Note that this is how we'll validate type mappings (catch ValueErrors, or some subclass thereof). This should include handling an invalid number of args correctly.

2012-09-03 Try stronger support for guessing param types. Maybe a basic type guesser and support for explicit type mappings in case the guesser fails badly. We could also let users pass a type-guessing callable to the App constructor; it takes a string and returns an instance of whatever type it decided was appropriate.

2012-05-09 Let Bob, Josh, Spencer, and Nate M. know when the first release is pushed to GitHub.

2012-09-07 Support '--' specifying that there are no options after it, and that all remaining input should be treated literally.

2012-09-07 Consider trying to evaluate python inside backticks in docstrings. That would let things like `os.linesep` display the actual character in help messages. This is probably too clever - it would add a lot of complexity for little gain. Another option - match param name to actual param and substitute the default value?

2012-05-15 Consider adding an @app.flag decorator. This would let us support weird flags like '--version', which traditionally make an app bail out early and ignore all other inputs.

2012-09-03 Fix bug where options are interpreted as commands if they come after '--help'.

2012-05-16 See if there's a cleaner/more flexible way to support global options. My current approach feels clunky - maybe I shouldn't be assuming we'll only be passed globals()?

2012-09-10 Add help paging of some kind. A long help document makes you scroll to read, which is annoying.

2012-05-04 Support config files.

2012-05-04 Consider renaming @app.main to @app (is it cleaner?).

2012-05-08 Support app defaults for param_type and short_names.

2012-05-12 Consider storing param_type functions directly in the Option and Arg classes. It might clear things up a bit.

2012-05-08 Consider adding a few useful type converters. A Python implementation of approxidate would be nice (and should be its own module): https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/date.c

2012-08-31 Make sure make_global_opts() actually uses its param_types arg (assuming it still exists).

2012-05-04 Convert DEBUG and GRIPE comments into actions.

2012-05-08 Consider making this a wrapper around one of the existing optparsing libraries, which could save heavy lifting in building powerful apps. Doing it earlier would have saved more effort, but still worth looking at.

2012-05-07 Decide whether multiple options/flags that start with the same letter should automatically cause InvalidShortName exceptions. They currently do, which could be quite surprising. Maybe 'generate short names' should be some sort of opt-in toggle?

2012-05-07 Consider fixing '-' option behavior. Many apps accept multiple short names after a hyphen, if at most the last one requires a value.

2012-09-02 Rename default_args_passed to kwargs_passed. It's an internal variable for a few methods, and the current name is actively wrong.

2012-09-03 Rename param_types to arg_types. It's shorter and clearer, since we convert command arguments to specific types, not params generally.

2012-05-07 Consider support for commands that accept *args (maybe **kwargs?).

2012-09-10 Port to Python 3 - if all the preceding items are handled, it means someone is using this thing (even if it's just me), and they may want to use a framework to help them with it.

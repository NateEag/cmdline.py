2012-05-04 Handle exceptions properly. Right now they just print a useless message. Note that this is how we'll validate type mappings (catch ValueErrors, or something like them).

2012-05-04 Introspect usage messages for the app and any subcommands. Could involve requirements on docstring formatting and contents.

2012-05-04 Consider renaming @app.main to @app (is it cleaner?).

2012-05-08 Make it possible to set app-wide defaults for param_type and short_names.

2012-05-08 Consider adding a few useful type converters. A Python implementation of approxidate would be nice (and should be its own module): https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/date.c

2012-05-04 Support global options. Functions in the module would read values from them, and they would not be passed to the command in question. Is there a sane way to make module constants work?

2012-05-04 Support config files.

2012-05-04 Convert DEBUG and GRIPE comments into actions.

2012-05-08 Consider making this a wrapper around one of the existing optparsing libraries, which could save heavy lifting in building powerful apps. Doing it earlier would have saved more effort, but still worth looking at.

2012-05-07 Decide whether multiple options/flags that start with the same letter should automatically cause InvalidShortName exceptions. They currently do, which could be quite surprising. Maybe 'generate short names' should be some sort of opt-in toggle?

2012-05-07 Consider fixing '-' option behavior. GNU apps accept multiple short names after a hyphen, if at most the last one requires a value.

2012-05-07 Consider support for commands that accept *args (maybe **kwargs?).

2012-05-15 Consider adding an @app.flag decorator. This would let us support weird flags like '--version' and '--help', which traditionally make an app bail out early and ignore all other inputs.

2012-05-04 Introspect basic usage messages for the app and any subcommands. Could involve requirements on docstring formatting and contents for advanced info.

2012-05-04 Handle exceptions properly. Right now they just print a useless message. Note that this is how we'll validate type mappings (catch ValueErrors, or something like them).

2012-05-09 Let Bob, Josh, and Spencer know when the first release is pushed to GitHub.

2012-05-16 See if there's a cleaner/more flexible way to support global options. My current approach feels clunky - maybe I shouldn't be assuming we'll only be passed globals()?

2012-05-04 Support config files.

2012-05-04 Consider renaming @app.main to @app (is it cleaner?).

2012-05-08 Support app defaults for param_type and short_names.

2012-05-12 Consider storing param_type functions directly in the Option and Arg classes. It might clear things up a bit.

2012-05-08 Consider adding a few useful type converters. A Python implementation of approxidate would be nice (and should be its own module): https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/date.c

2012-05-04 Convert DEBUG and GRIPE comments into actions.

2012-05-08 Consider making this a wrapper around one of the existing optparsing libraries, which could save heavy lifting in building powerful apps. Doing it earlier would have saved more effort, but still worth looking at.

2012-05-07 Decide whether multiple options/flags that start with the same letter should automatically cause InvalidShortName exceptions. They currently do, which could be quite surprising. Maybe 'generate short names' should be some sort of opt-in toggle?

2012-05-07 Consider fixing '-' option behavior. Many apps accept multiple short names after a hyphen, if at most the last one requires a value.

2012-05-07 Consider support for commands that accept *args (maybe **kwargs?).

2012-05-04 Support optional type annotations for function inputs. They should let us cast inputs before passing them to functions and also handle input validation.

2012-05-04 Introspect usage messages for the app and any subcommands. Could involve requirements on docstring formatting and contents.

2012-05-04 Handle exceptions properly. Right now they just print themselves.

2012-05-04 Consider making @app a decorator (cleaner than @app.main?).

2012-05-04 Support global options. Functions in the module would read values from them, and they would not be passed to the command in question. Is there a sane way to make module constants work?

2012-05-04 Support config files.

2012-05-04 Convert DEBUG and GRIPE comments into actions.

2012-05-07 Decide whether multiple options/flags that start with the same letter should automatically cause InvalidShortName exceptions. They currently do, which could be quite surprising. Maybe 'generate short names' should be some sort of opt-in toggle?

2012-05-07 Consider fixing '-' option behavior. GNU apps accept multiple short names after a hyphen, if at most the last one requires a value.

2012-05-07 Add support for commands that accept *args (and maybe **kwargs?).

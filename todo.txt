2012-05-04 Make hello.greet() return a string, rather than print directly to stdout, but still have command-line app display output. If @app.command accepted an optional formatter that defaulted to string, it might work.

2012-05-04 Support short names for options and flags. @app.command should accept an optional 'shortnames' dict that maps variable names to shortnames.

2012-05-04 Support optional type annotations for function inputs. They should let us cast inputs before passing them to functions and also handle input validation.

2012-05-04 Introspect usage messages for the app and any subcommands.

2012-05-04 Consider making opt_args an optional arg to @app.command, rather than encoding 'Optional Args:' in the docstring. Dropping docstring 'sections' would be part of this.

2012-05-04 Handle exceptions properly.

2012-05-04 Consider making @app a decorator (cleaner than @app.main?).

2012-05-04 Support global options. Functions in the module would read values from them, and they would not be passed to the command in question. Is there a sane way to make module constants work?

2012-05-04 Support config files.

2012-05-04 Convert DEBUG and GRIPE comments into actions.
